# CLAUDE.md — OpenClaw (ClawBot)

Guidance for Claude Code in this repo. Keep it short and current.

## Project
Local-LLM crypto trading + assistant bot. Telegram-controlled, Flask web dashboard,
APScheduler loop. Local Ollama brain with Claude API fallback. Remote: `openclaw.git`.

## Run
- **Entry:** `python start.py` — launches the Telegram bot + Flask dashboard in one process.
- Requires `.env` (git-ignored): Telegram, Crypto.com, Anthropic, Ollama config.

## Layout
- `content/` — Telegram receiver + command handlers
- `core/` — LLM brain, conversation history, scheduler, market data
- `trading/` — exchange (Crypto.com), strategy, executor, backtest
- `agents/` — news, sheets, auto-upgrade, code review, failure memory
- `dashboard/` — Flask dashboard
- `security/` — whitelist auth, audit log, blocklist
- `voice/` — Whisper transcription
- `data/` — runtime logs/reports (git-ignored)
- `trash_hauling_bot/` — separate HaulYeah lead-gen bot (its own venv + `.env.haulyeah`)

## Rules
- Never hardcode secrets — use `.env`.
- **Archive, don't delete** (`_Archive/`); retired clutter lives there and is git-ignored.
- Log trade decisions; the LLM confirms trade signals before execution.
- No broad refactors without asking first.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
